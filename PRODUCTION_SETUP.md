# 🚀 Production Setup Guide

## Overview
This application has been upgraded from a demo system to a production-ready application with proper Supabase Auth integration, JWT token management, and security best practices.

## 🔐 Authentication System

### What Changed
- ❌ **Removed**: Demo credentials display
- ❌ **Removed**: Basic bcrypt password verification
- ❌ **Removed**: localStorage-based authentication
- ✅ **Added**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- ✅ **Added**: Proper session management
- ✅ **Added**: Password strength validation
- ✅ **Added**: Email verification
- ✅ **Added**: Secure password reset

### Security Features
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, time-limited authentication tokens
- **Password Strength**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- **Email Verification**: Required before first login
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Supabase security

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Database Setup
The following migration has been applied:
- ✅ `create_production_user_account` - Sets up proper user tables and security policies

### 3. Create Production User Account

#### Option A: Use the Setup Script (Recommended)
```typescript
import { setupProductionUser } from './src/scripts/setupProductionUser';

// Run this once in development
const result = await setupProductionUser();
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Production user created:', result.message);
}
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup
1. **Sign up through the application**:
   - Email: `marketing@shiva-engineering.com`
   - Password: `SecurePass123!` (or your chosen strong password)
   - The system will create both Supabase Auth user and team member profile

2. **Verify email**:
   - Check email for verification link
   - Click to verify account

3. **First login**:
   - Use verified credentials to sign in
   - System will create secure session

### 4. Password Requirements
Production passwords must meet:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Regular Password Updates**: Enforce password changes every 90 days
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Consider enabling MFA for admin accounts
3. **Session Monitoring**: Monitor active sessions and suspicious activity
4. **Access Control**: Regularly review user permissions and roles

### For Users
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
2. **Session Security**: Log out when using shared devices
3. **Email Security**: Keep email account secure for password resets
4. **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious activity immediately

## 🚨 Migration Notes

### From Demo System
- Old bcrypt passwords are no longer supported
- Users must create new accounts through proper signup process
- Email verification is now required
- Sessions are managed by Supabase, not localStorage

### Data Preservation
- Existing team member data is preserved
- User IDs are updated to link with Supabase Auth
- Historical data remains intact

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Required Email Templates
1. **Signup Verification**: Sent when user creates account
2. **Password Reset**: Sent when user requests password reset
3. **Email Change**: Sent when user changes email address

### Email Provider Setup
Configure your email provider in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication > Email Templates
2. Customize templates with your branding
3. Test email delivery

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "User profile not found"
- Ensure team member profile exists in database
- Check email address matches exactly
- Verify profile status is 'active'

#### "Email not confirmed"
- Check spam/junk folder
- Resend verification email
- Verify email address is correct

#### "Invalid login credentials"
- Verify email and password
- Check if account is active
- Ensure email is verified

### Support
For production issues:
1. Check Supabase logs in dashboard
2. Review application console logs
3. Contact system administrator
4. Check Supabase status page
